My first repository

Hi. I'm a college student at UPRM.
Am currently coursing my second year in a Physics bachellor program.
I enjoy cooking (I love food!) and playing guitar (just started learning recently), my favorite language is Math, and my aspiration is to become a professor in Physics (don't know yet specifically which branch of Physics; all of them fascinate me).
